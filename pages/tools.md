#### <a name="fat"></a>[trau ![trau](../assets/pics/trau.jpg)](https://github.com/diepbp/fat) /ʃoʊ/

A string solver to check satisfiability of string constraints based on flattening and CEGAR.
This idea is used to build a CEGAR framework that simultaneously maintains an underapproximation and an overapproximation of a constraint in the form of sets of flat automata.

The technique is also described in the paper [Flatten and Conquer (A Framework for Efficient Analysis of String Constraints)]() at ...

Installation instructions as well as a simple manual can be found on the [Github page ![GitHub](icons16/github-icon.png)](https://github.com/diepbp/fat)
