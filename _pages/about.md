* I am a PhD student in [Department of Information Technology](http://www.it.uu.se/) at [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se/); 
member of [Algorithmic Program Verification](http://www.it.uu.se/research/docs/fm/apv) group. 
My research interest lie in general idea of program verification and constraint solving, particularly in verification of concurrent programs and checking satisfiability of string constraints.

* In May 2015, I started a PhD program in Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University under the supversion of [Mohamed Faouzi Atig](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/mohat117) and [Parosh Aziz Abdulla](http://user.it.uu.se/~parosh/). 

* I obtained a M.Sc in Computer Science from [University of Engineering and Technology, VNUH](http://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn) in December 2014.
